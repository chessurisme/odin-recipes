      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon or ham until browned, turning once, for about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring some water to a boil and add the vinegar. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and carefully crack one egg at a time into a small bowl, then slide it into the water. Poach the eggs for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to a paper towel-lined plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter and keep warm. In a blender or a food processor, combine the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt and pepper and blend until smooth. With the blender running, slowly drizzle in the melted butter and blend until thick and creamy.</li>
        <li>To assemble the dish, place one muffin half on each plate and top with a slice of bacon or ham.</li>
        <li>Place a poached egg over the bacon or ham and spoon some of the hollandaise sauce over the egg.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some parsley or paprika if desired and enjoy!</li>
